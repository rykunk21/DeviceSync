As the name implies, datatype modifiers are used with built-in data 
types to modify the length of data that a particular data type can hold.
Data type modifiers in C++ are:

    - signed
    - unsigned
    - short
    - long

Note: Going from a double to an int simply removes the decimal. Thereâ€™s no rounding involved.




ImprovedContains takes three arguments: a string representing the text to search, 
a string representing the pattern to search for, and a pointer to bool that 
represents if the search should be case insensitive. 
This function should return true if the pattern is found 
in the text, false otherwise.

ImprovedMatches takes three arguments: a string representing the
text to search, a string representing the pattern to search for, 
and a pointer to bool that represents if the search should be 
case insensitive. This function should return the number of times 
the pattern is found in the text.

ImprovedFindFirstOf takes three arguments: a string representing 
the text to search, a string representing the pattern to search for, 
and a pointer to bool that represents if the search should be case 
insensitive. This function should return the index in the text that the 
pattern is found, return -1 if pattern is not found.

ImprovedReplace takes four arguments: a string representing the text 
to search, a string representing the pattern to search for, a string 
representing the new content to replace the pattern in the text with, and 
a pointer to bool that represents if the search should be case insensitive.

ImprovedNumberOfDifferences takes three arguments: two strings that will 
be compared character by character, and a bool that represents if the 
comparison should be case insensitive. This function should return the 
number of characters that differ between the two strings. You can assume 
that neither string contains special characters.
